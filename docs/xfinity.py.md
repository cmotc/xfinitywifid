Functions
------------

  * def **randomize_mac():** This generates a random MAC address but does not
  set it. Appears to do it this way so it can reliably keep the first 3 digits
  of the MAC address.
  * def **restart_wifi():** This turns the wifi off and back on again.
  * def **set_mac(mac):** This sets the MAC address of the wireless device to
  the randomly generated MAC.
  * def **fill_out_form():** This controls the scriptable browser and directs it
  to fill out a form and submit it. This authorizes you with the free trial for
  the xfinity account and completes your connection to the internet.
